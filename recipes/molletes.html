        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>8 ounces dried pinto beans</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of olive oil</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>16 slices white whole wheat bread</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded queso blanco</li>
            <li>⅓ cup chile-garlic sauce (such as Sriracha®)</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place beans in a saucepan and add enough water to cover them by 1 inch. Bring to a boil and remove from heat. 
                Let stand for 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Drain and rinse beans. Add enough fresh water to cover by 1 inch. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 2 hours. Drain, reserving 1/2 cup of the cooking water, and rinse.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add beans and salt. Fry until beans are very soft, stirring and mashing frequently, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler on low heat</li>
            <li>Spread an equal amount of beans on each slice of bread and sprinkle queso on top. Place bread slices on a baking sheet.

            </li>
            <li>Broil until beans are warmed and cheese is melted, about 3 minutes. Remove from oven and top with chile-garlic sauce.</li>
        </ol>
